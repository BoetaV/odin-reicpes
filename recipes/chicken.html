<h3>Prepare with ease</h3>
<p>I’ve always loved the versatility of chicken recipes and this one doesn’t disappoint one bit. This is the type of dish you usually get at a restaurant, but it’s super simple to make right at home.</p>

<ul> 

<li>Chicken breast fillets breaded</li>
<li>in a bit of flour</li>
<li>pan fried to a golden perfection</li>
<li>and served with a mushroom and Marsala wine sauce</li>
</ul> 

<p>This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.</p>

    <li>Fast Prep Time</li>

    <li>Ready in 45 Min</li>
